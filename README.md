# Legal Research Chatbot

The **Legal Research Chatbot** is a Python-based application that allows users to query legal questions and receive responses based on the contents of PDF documents stored on Google Drive. It utilizes machine learning techniques like embeddings, document retrieval, and generative models for question answering.

This chatbot can:
- Extract text from PDF files stored in Google Drive.
- Generate embeddings for document content.
- Find relevant documents using a query and return answers using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model.

## Features
- **PDF text extraction**: Extracts text from PDF files using OCR and text-based techniques.
- **Embeddings generation**: Converts text data into numerical embeddings for efficient document search.
- **Legal query answering**: Users can ask questions, and the system retrieves relevant legal documents to generate answers.
- **Flask Web Interface**: A simple web app that interacts with the user and returns answers.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following software installed:
- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **Google Drive API access** for document storage
